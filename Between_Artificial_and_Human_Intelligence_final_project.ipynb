        "Overall, the in-context learning technique did not significantly correct the bias in most models tested, particularly in GPT-2 and Gemma-2b, which showed no change in their biased responses. Phi-3 exhibited a marginal improvement, suggesting some level of learning and adaptation but still maintained a statistically significant bias."

        "In this study, we observed significant biases across all models tested, with minimal impact from in-context learning techniques, particularly in GPT-2 and Gemma-2b, which continued to demonstrate a strong skew towards a single response type despite variations in training. Although Phi-3 showed a slight improvement, suggesting some capability to adapt to contextual cues, its performance still indicated a notable presence of bias."
