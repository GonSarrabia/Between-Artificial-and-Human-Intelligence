![Course Cover](sandbox:/mnt/data/A_cover_image_for_a_course_titled_'Bridging_Artifi.png)

This repository holds resources and projects for the course "Bridging Artificial and Human Intelligence," exploring how cognitive science and AI intersect to understand language acquisition, processing, and representation in the human brain and AI systems.

## Course Overview

This course integrates insights from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science to offer a comprehensive view of language acquisition. It delves into historical debates on language learning, computational models simulating this process, and the latest applications of deep learning in natural language processing (NLP).

## Key Topics

- Historical views on language acquisition
- Introduction to natural language processing (NLP)
- Understanding word embeddings and their properties
- Training and fine-tuning language models like GPT-2
- Exploring the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
- Cross-modality and multimodal models, focusing on models like WHISPER
- Analyzing speech and language embeddings and their neural alignment
- In-context learning vs. plasticity-based approaches in AI
- Practical workshops integrating cognitive psychology with advanced AI models

## Projects

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks, data files, and reference materials for these projects:

- **Project 1: Language Model Analysis**
  Investigate how large language models capture spontaneous speech and its neural correlates.

- **Project 2: Multimodal Learning**
  Explore the capabilities of multimodal models in processing human-centric concepts.

- **Project 3: In-Context Learning**
  Analyze the potential of in-context learning to capture complex cognitive patterns without retraining models.

- **Final Project: Cognitive Biases in LLMs**
  Conduct an analysis to investigate language models' susceptibility to cognitive biases and techniques to understand and mitigate these biases.

## Tools and Libraries

Throughout the course, we use various tools and libraries, including:

- [Hugging Face's Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/)
- [OpenAI's GPT models](https://openai.com/)
- [WHISPER](https://openai.com/research/whisper)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

## Usage

To run the notebooks, launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

OR

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the project folder and open the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) to view the materials.
